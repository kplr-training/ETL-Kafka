### Notes : 

- You should cd into the /usr folder for commands to work

- The KEY syntax used has been recently deprecated   
  You have to use the syntax below : 

```
CREATE TABLE users_original (GENDER STRING, REGIONID STRING,USERID INT PRIMARY KEY) WITH (kafka_topic='users', value_format='JSON');
```
